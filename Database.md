## Disclaimers:
- The limit for the public of effective dose is [1 mSv]/y (individuals not exposed on a professional level)
- The limit for cat B workers is [6 mSv]/y (medical professional, aircrew staff...)
- The limit for cat A is [20 mSv]/y (senior experts in case of accidental events...)
- There are different limits for different parts of the body (partial irradiation), the eye's crystalline is especially sensitive ([15 mSv]/y for the public) 

----------------------------

### Important considerations that would be nice to include:
- dose considering elevation
- dose considering area of residence
- dose considering a stone, brick or concrete building
- dose considering food, water and air
- dose considering nuclear fallout
- dose considering miles travelled by plane

Also some fun questions would be, keeping in mind that:
100 REM = 1 Sv
